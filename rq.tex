\section{Research Questions}

Guided by the theoretical frameworks above and motivated by the need for naturalistic evidence, this thesis investigates how players describe interactive demands and how these demands relate to emotional outcomes in online discussion. The study is guided by the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do Reddit users articulate and describe the cognitive, emotional, physical, social, and controller demands experienced during video game play?
    \item Which types of interactive demands are most frequently discussed across Reddit gaming communities?
    \item In what ways do players express enjoyment, frustration, or balance in relation to these demands?
    \item How do patterns in Reddit discussions reflect, reinforce, or extend the Interactivity-as-Demand framework \parencite{vorderer_interactivity_2021}?
\end{enumerate}
