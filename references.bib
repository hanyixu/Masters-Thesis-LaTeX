	abstract = {People have never played more video games, and many stakeholders are worried that this activity might be bad for players. So far, research has not had adequate data to test whether these worries are justified and if policymakers should act to regulate video game play time. We attempt to provide much-needed evidence with adequate data. Whereas previous research had to rely on self-reported play behaviour, we collaborated with two games companies, Electronic Arts and Nintendo of America, to obtain players' actual play behaviour. We surveyed players of
              Plants
              vs.
              Zombies: Battle for Neighborville
              and
              Animal Crossing: New Horizons
              for their well-being, motivations and need satisfaction during play, and merged their responses with telemetry data (i.e. logged game play). Contrary to many fears that excessive play time will lead to addiction and poor mental health, we found a small positive relation between game play and affective well-being. Need satisfaction and motivations during play did not interact with play time but were instead independently related to well-being. Our results advance the field in two important ways. First, we show that collaborations with industry partners can be done to high academic standards in an ethical and transparent fashion. Second, we deliver much-needed evidence to policymakers on the link between play and mental health.},

Using structural equation modeling, relationships between ego depletion, procrastination, guilt, enjoyment, vitality, and recovery experience were tested using data from an online survey (N = 471). Results suggest that ego depletion may increase the risk of negatively appraising the use of interactive (video games) and noninteractive (television) entertaining media as a form of procrastination. The resulting guilt is negatively related to the recovery experience associated with using entertainment. Therefore, ego-depleted individuals may benefit less from the psychological recovery potential of entertainment media, despite their greater need for recovery. These findings are an important step in understanding the pivotal role of appraisal processes for media-induced recovery and the entertainment experience.},

In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-purpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be fine-tuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40\%, while retaining 97\% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60\% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.},

Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks.},

Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods—they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

It is however not yet clear how affective games are being evaluated, what the precise effects are, and how they are based on emotion theoretical concepts that are still not universally agreed upon. This systematic review investigated these questions by analysing relevant high-quality evaluation studies of the effect of affect-adaptive video games on various outcomes in regards to their effects, theoretical assumptions, and methodologies. Out of 3,930 papers, 26 studies were included based on preregistered inclusion and exclusion criteria. A high variance regarding theoretical assumptions and methodological approaches was observed, as well as an overall poor methodological rigour, leading to the conclusion that more work is needed in constructing better methodological standards for game evaluation studies and theoretical considerations when developing and testing affect-adaptive video games.},

	abstract = {Interactive media such as video games and virtual reality (VR) provide users with lived experiences that may be dangerous or even impossible in daily life. By providing interactive experiences in highly authentic, detail-rich contexts, these technologies have demonstrated measurable success in impacting how people think, feel, and behave in the physical world. At the same time, violent interactive media content has been historically connected with a range of antisocial effects in both popular press and academic research. Extant literature has established a small-but-statistically significant effect of interactive media violence on aggressive thoughts and behaviors, which could serve as a risk factor for interpersonal violence. However, left unexplored is the seemingly paradoxical claim that under some conditions, interactive media experiences might protect against interpersonal violence. Drawing on advances in media theory and research and the evolution of interactive media content and production practices, the current manuscript suggests ways in which interactive media violence may be leveraged to lower the likelihood of real-world violence experiences. For example, research on both violent and non-violent games has found that players can (a) express guilt after committing violent acts, (b) report reflective and introspective emotional reactions during gameplay, and (c) debate the morality of their actions with others. Regarding VR, studies have demonstrated that (a) witnessing physical violence in immersive spaces led participants to take the perspective of victims and better understand their emotional state and (b) controlled exposure to traumatic or violent events can be used for treatment. Broadly, studies into video games and VR demonstrate that the impact of actions in virtual worlds transfer into the physical worlds to influence (later) attitudes and behaviors. Thus, how these experiences may be potentially harnessed for social change is a compelling and open consideration, as are side-effects of such interventions on vulnerable groups. The current manuscript summarizes emerging research perspectives (as well as their limitations) to offer insight into the potential for interactive media violence to protect against real-world violence victimization and perpetration.},

            The interactive nature of video games has perpetually drawn the focus of game developers and game scholars alike—the former eager to create immersive and involving digital worlds to shock and awe players, and the latter eager to understand the potential for powerful effects stemming from this immersion and involvement. Yet as video games evolve in terms of their technology and their content, the relationship between the player and the system becomes increasingly complex. This dialogue demands near-constant attention from the players, and these demands exist on at least four dimensions: cognitive, emotional, physical, and social. In the present chapter, these four demands are explicated, theoretically and empirically positioned as entertaining in their own right, and discussed as important mediators of media entertainment experiences.},

	abstract = {In-game team communication in online multiplayer games has shown the potential to foster efficient collaboration and positive social interactions. Yet players often associate communication within ad hoc teams with frustration and wariness. Though previous works have quantitatively analyzed communication patterns at scale, few have identified the motivations of how a player makes in-the-moment communication decisions. In this paper, we conducted an observation study with 22 League of Legends players by interviewing them during Solo Ranked games on their use of four in-game communication media (chat, pings, emotes, votes). We performed thematic analysis to understand players’ in-context assessment and perception of communication attempts. We demonstrate that players evaluate communication opportunities on proximate game states bound by player expectations and norms. Our findings illustrate players’ tendency to view communication, regardless of its content, as a precursor to team breakdowns. We build upon these findings to motivate effective player-oriented communication design in online games.},

Accordingly, research guided by self-determination theory has focused on the social–contextual conditions that facilitate versus forestall the natural processes of self-motivation and healthy psychological development. Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psychological needs—competence, autonomy, and relatedness—which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished motivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.

	abstract = {This chapter challenges traditional models of deindividuation. These are based on the assumption that such factors as immersion in a group and anonymity lead to a loss of selfhood and hence of control over behaviour. We argue that such models depend upon an individualistic conception of the self, viewed as a unitary construct referring to that which makes individuals unique. This is rejected in favour of the idea that self can be defined at various different levels including the categorical self as well as the personal self. Hence a social identity model of deindividuation (SIDE) is outlined. Evidence is presented to show that deindividuation manipulations gain effect, firstly, through the ways in which they affect the salience of social identity (and hence conformity to categorical norms) and, secondly, through their effects upon strategic considerations relating to the expression of social identities. We conclude that the classic deindividuation paradigm of anonymity within a social group, far from leading to uncontrolled behaviour, maximizes the opportunity of group members to give full voice to their collective identities.},

Before the computer or its designer can adapt an interaction to better serve an individual user, feedback from that user must be associated with the actions of the machine: did a specific computer action please or displease the user? Did something in the interaction frustrate the user? One of the essential issues is sensing and recognizing the affective information communicated by the user in a way that is comfortable and reliable. This paper highlights several devices we have built that offer users means of communicating affective information to a computer.},

	abstract = {Affective design and the determination of engineering specifications are commonly conducted separately in early product design stage. Generally, designers and engineers are required to determine the settings of design attributes (for affective design) and engineering requirements (for engineering design), respectively, for new products. Some design attributes and some engineering requirements could be common. However, the settings of the design attributes and engineering requirements could be different because of the separation of the two processes. In previous studies, a methodology that considers the determination of the settings of the design attributes and engineering requirements simultaneously was not found. To bridge this gap, a methodology for considering affective design and the determination of engineering specifications of a new product simultaneously is proposed. The proposed methodology mainly involves generation of customer satisfaction models, formulation of a multi-objective optimisation model and its solving using a chaos-based NSGA-II. To illustrate and validate the proposed methodology, a case study of mobile phone design was conducted. A validation test was conducted and the test results showed that the customer satisfaction values obtained based on the proposed methodology were higher than those obtained based on the combined standalone quality function deployment and standalone affective design approach.},

In fact, uses and gratifications has always provided a cutting-edge theoretical approach in the initial stages of each new mass communications medium: newspapers, radio and television, and now the Internet. Although scientists are likely to continue using traditional tools and typologies to answer questions about media use, we must also be prepared to expand our current theoretical models of uses and gratifications. Contemporary and future models must include concepts such as interactivity, demassification, hypertextuality, and asynchroneity. Researchers must also be willing to explore interpersonal and qualitative aspects of mediated communication in a more holistic methodology.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games have garnered widespread popularity as a form of recreational activity. The launch of League of Legends (LoL), a prominent MOBA game, has captivated the enthusiastic pursuit of gamers in the MOBA community. The surge in MOBA game fervor, coupled with the influence of personal emotions, can result in excessive engagement, ultimately leading to addiction. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the moderating effects of visceral perception, behavior, and reflection on game players' addiction within the framework of Leisure Theory (LT), Uses and Gratification Theory (UGT), and Emotional Design Theory (EDT). Methods: A hypothesized theoretical model was developed and empirically evaluated based on 236 self-reported validated responses from MOBA gamers. SPSS (version 26) was employed for demographic analysis and game duration analysis. The measurement model and structural model analyses were conducted in two stages using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS 4.1.0 to validate the nine theoretical hypotheses. Results: It has been observed that personal emotions significantly contributes to MOBA game addiction during gamers' leisure time or moments of gratification. Specifically, a noteworthy connection exists between two dimensions, namely gamers' behavior and reflection, demonstrating a positive correlation with gaming addiction. Without taking entertainment as a motivating factor, there is no significant relationship between gamers' leisure-time and visceral perception.This study enhances the theoretical model of gamers' behavioral motives in engaging with MOBA gaming and contributes to the expansion of research on game addiction theory. These findings offer valuable theoretical insights for emotional design in games and the design of mechanisms for preventing game addiction.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              In video gaming, tilt is thought to relate to poor emotional control and game performance. Despite widespread recognition of tilt in video gaming, there is a lack of research examining tilt empirically.
            
            
              Methods
              One thousand and seven gamers took part in our online study examining gamers experience of tilt, the factors which contribute to and protect against tilt, and the emotion regulation strategies gamers employ to deal with tilt.
            
            
              Results
              Gamers who reported playing for more competitive reasons, were at higher risk of experiencing tilt. Additional factors associated with an increased risk of experiencing tilt were increased anger and more hours spent playing. Protective factors against experiencing tilt were also identified, inclusive of a greater number of years gaming experience and engagement in adaptive emotion regulation strategies.
            
            
              Discussion
              This study provides an important starting point for creating a better understanding of tilt in gaming, equipping us with new knowledge to better support gamers to improve their emotion regulation during game play performance},

Survey data from 1213 randomly sampled World of Tanks players were combined with their behavioral data to investigate how players’ behaviors and their corresponding need satisfaction differ or converge across age. Age and in-game behaviors were tested as moderators for the relationship between perceived need satisfaction and psychological well-being. The results showed that despite underperforming and having fewer in-game connections, older players reported no significant difference in their perceived competence and relatedness than younger players. Perceived competence and relatedness contributed to psychological well-being for both older and younger players, although it carried more weight for the younger.

We then scored perceived emotional challenge ratings and coded the responses according to referenced affective game design patterns to categorize levels of reflection achieved. We found a significant difference (p {\textless} 0.011) in emotional challenge ratings and mean ranks increased across the five reflection groups, from lowest reflective level (non-reflective description) to highest (critical reflection). This demonstrates that the more emotionally challenged participants felt, the greater the depth of their reflection was.

	abstract = {The aim of this research is to make precise forecasts on player participation in online game using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Player engagement plays a crucial element in determining the success of online games because it affects player retention, satisfaction and monetization. By understanding and predicting engagement levels, game developers and marketers can enhance the gaming experience and develop strategies to keep players invested. This research involves a comprehensive analysis of player behavior data from an online gaming platform. The dataset includes various demographic and behavioral features such as age, gender, location, game genre, playtime hours, in-game purchases, game difficulty, sessions per week, average session duration, player level, achievements unlocked, and engagement level. The data was preprocessed through handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships between different features. Multiple machine learning models were evaluated to predict player engagement levels, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models were then compared through the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. In the comparison, XGBoost emerged as the best model. Since it is the best-performing model, we can make the feature importance analysis to identify the best factors for predicting engagement in the next step. The XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy of 91\%, demonstrating superior precision, recall, and F1-scores across all engagement levels (High, Medium, Low). Ensemble methods like XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest outperformed the SVM model, highlighting their effectiveness in handling complex datasets.},

	abstract = {The swift evolution of modern technologies brought rapid advancements that led to the development of diverse forms of media that define the contemporary world. Among these, online games emerge as an influential trend that is leading the way in today's entertainment and interaction. This qualitative research aimed to determine the online gaming motivations of Filipino millennials, along with its connection to their gaming preferences and gaming continuance. The participants of the study were twelve (12) Filipino millennials who play online games, are currently employed, and residing in the National Capital Region. A semi-structured interview was used to collect data which was then analyzed through narrative thematic analysis. This resulted in nine major themes that encapsulate the gaming motivations of Filipino millennial gamers. The results show that the participants' primary motivations are the influence of their social environment, availability of gaming devices, appeal of gaming features, and use of gaming to cope. Moreover, their gaming preferences were also explored through reward systems, storyline, and game style. It was found that their initial gaming motivations were also the same drives for their continued gaming engagement. Essentially, Filipino millennial gamers consider gaming as a significant part of their lives. The implications of the study recommend propositions in education, career development, and counseling.},

	abstract = {There is currently substantial controversy regarding the reliability of observed patterns of perceptual learning. Contributing to this controversy are a lack of accounting for individual differences and how variations in training can give rise to different patterns of learning. Here we sought to investigate the impact of individual differences in attention, as measured with the Useful Field of View (UFOV) task, and action video game use on perceptual learning in a large sample of subjects trained on a Texture Discrimination Task (TDT). We examined baseline performance on the TDT, learning on the initially trained TDT stimuli and transfer to a subsequently trained background orientation. We find that participants showing better performance on the UFOV task performed better on the TDT, and also showed greater learning and transfer to an untrained background orientation. On the other hand, self-report of action video game play only inconsistently related performance, learning or transfer on the TDT. Further, we failed to replicate previous findings that training with different backgrounds gives rise to interference on the TDT. Together these results suggest that, while differences between individuals and differences in task structure play a role in perceptual learning, previous findings on the impact of action video game use and interference between training stimuli in perceptual learning may be idiosyncratic.},

Studies have employed a range of methodological approaches to study this, although the majority tend to use experimental methods. The current paper provides a review of the current literature on outcomes of “social gaming” alongside raising debate about the conceptual underpinnings of this term. A taxonomy is presented which draws distinctions for different types of “social gaming”. Namely, this conceptual mapping consists two dimensions of social presence (physical versus virtual) and behavioural interdependence (high versus low). The current review uses this taxonomy as a conceptual tool to map the existing literature in respect of how “social gaming” outcomes relate to these dimensions. This can help establish how much we really know about the outcomes of “social gaming” in respect of a more defined theoretical framework which to date has been unavailable in the current literature.},

Results of this study indicated that simple exposure (time spent on social media) was not related to body image concerns.

In this conceptual article, we suggest that a conversation between human–machine communication (HMC) and XAI is advantageous and necessary. Following the introduction of these two areas, we demonstrate how research on XAI can inform the HMC scholarship regarding the human-in-the-loop approach and the message production explainability. Next, we expound upon how communication scholars’ focuses on message sources, receivers, features, and effects can reciprocally benefit XAI research. At its core, this article proposes a two-level HMC framework and posits that bridging the two fields can guide future AI research and development.},

Due to its ubiquity in everyday life, wayfinding appears on the surface to be a simply characterized and understood process; however, this very ubiquity and the resulting need to refine and optimize wayfinding has led to a great number of studies that have revealed that it is in fact a deeply complex exercise. In this article, we examine the motivations for investigating wayfinding, with particular attention being paid to the unique challenges faced in transportation hubs, and discuss the associated principles and factors involved as they have been perceived from different research perspectives. We also review the approaches used to date in the modelling of wayfinding in various contexts. We attempt to draw together the different perspectives applied to wayfinding and postulate the importance of wayfinding and the need to understand this seemingly simple, but concurrently complex, process.},

Survey questions addressed 306 participants’ experiences in WoW, feelings of nostalgia and sense of place in Azeroth, and experiences with social presence in WoW; open-ended questions were asked about their motivations to play WoW. Prior overall WoW experience and higher sense of social presence increase personal nostalgia scores (replicating previous research). Sense of place scores increased with higher sense of social presence but were overall lower for current WoW Classic players. Social presence proved an important component of both personal nostalgia and sense of place. These findings expand and extend researchers’ understanding of the relationships between nostalgia, sense of place, and social presence within this unique site of study.},

SoP scores were compared between WV natives and non-natives, with the expectation that natives would have greater SoP scores prior to gameplay. The expected T1 SoP gap was found, but this gap closed for all players at T2, with non-natives experiencing a significant increase in their SoP for WV on par with natives’ feelings of the same. For those no longer playing, T3 SoP scores returned to T1 (preplay) levels. Effects on place recollection (such as recalling location names) were similar but less pronounced. Although an early exploration into SoP and video games, these data have implications for SoP considerations in video game research and design.},

To begin addressing those shortcomings, we (a) synthesize extant scholarship to propose a SPIREs framework for SoP (comprising symbolism, purpose, identity, relation, and emotion dimensions) and (b) conduct a descriptive study of SoP dimensions across physical and digital, positively and negatively valenced spaces. Our analysis induced a hierarchy of complex themes and subthemes for each dimension—findings that point to SoP's conceptual independence from valence and materiality and its likely polythetic structure.},

The study found competitive players and recreational players had different motivations. Competitive players were more motivated by competition, achievement, and Schwabism, whereas the recreational players were more motivated by escape and passing time.

Research looking into the association between social media use (SMU) and mental health outcomes, such as anxiety or depressive symptoms, have produced mixed ﬁndings. These contradictions may best be addressed by examining different patterns of SMU as they relate to depressive symptomatology. We sought to assess the independent associations between active versus passive SMU and depressive symptoms. For this, we conducted an online survey of adults 18–49 of age. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System brief depression scale. We measured active and passive SMU with previously developed items. Factor analysis was used to explore the underlying factor structure. Then, we used ordered logistic regression to assess associations between both passive and active SMU and depressive symptoms while controlling for sociodemographic covariates. Complete data were received from 702 participants. Active and passive SMU items loaded on separate factors. In multivariable analyses that controlled for all covariates, each one-point increase in passive SMU was associated with a 33 percent increase in depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.33, 95 percent conﬁdence interval [CI] = 1.17–1.51). However, in the same multivariable model, each one-point increase in active SMU was associated with a 15 percent decrease in depressive symptoms (AOR = 0.85, 95 percent CI = 0.75–0.96). To inform interventions, future research should determine directionality of these associations and investigate related factors.},

A bibliometric analysis indicated the evolution of academic research on social media. The results of a survey of 280 social media practitioners shed the light on the gap between academic social media research and the practice of professionals. A qualitative study also offered novel insights and recommendations for future developments in academic research on social media. The findings of this paper showed that academic research on social media is growing in terms of the number of publications but is struggling in three areas: visibility, relevance, and influence on practitioners. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on social media. The implications of our study are derived from the importance of our findings on the directions to publish more relevant and timely academic research on social media. While extensive studies exist on social media, their influence on practitioners is still limited.},

	abstract = {Social robots can benefit aging people, especially those with restricted social interactions and health care, but how do resource-poor older adults respond to them? In this study, 5 focus groups with 60 older participants in rural China revealed their perceptions of social robots, concerns about the technology, and the types of social robots they were likely to accept. The participants cited multiple technological, discomfort, privacy, safety, and financial fraud concerns. They struggled to define robots as machines, humans, or something else but preferred small-sized, animal-shaped, or young female-gendered human-like robots. Their interconnected perceptions, concerns, and preferences illuminate a resource-poor group’s struggles, imaginations, hopes, uncertainties, and vulnerabilities when a new social and technological actor is embedded in their social worlds, reflecting how people understand social robots in relation to themselves and themselves in relation to social robots. Our study findings contribute to understanding social robots’ subjectivities and ways to design culturally and socially acceptable robots.},

	abstract = {Recent studies in social media spam and automation provide anecdotal argumentation of the rise of a new generation of spambots, so-called social spambots. Here, for the ﬁrst time, we extensively study this novel phenomenon on Twitter and we provide quantitative evidence that a paradigm-shift exists in spambot design. First, we measure current Twitter’s capabilities of detecting the new social spambots. Later, we assess the human performance in discriminating between genuine accounts, social spambots, and traditional spambots. Then, we benchmark several state-of-the-art techniques proposed by the academic literature. Results show that neither Twitter, nor humans, nor cutting-edge applications are currently capable of accurately detecting the new social spambots. Our results call for new approaches capable of turning the tide in the ﬁght against this raising phenomenon. We conclude by reviewing the latest literature on spambots detection and we highlight an emerging common research trend based on the analysis of collective behaviors. Insights derived from both our extensive experimental campaign and survey shed light on the most promising directions of research and lay the foundations for the arms race against the novel social spambots. Finally, to foster research on this novel phenomenon, we make publicly available to the scientiﬁc community all the datasets used in this study.},

	abstract = {“Why do people migrate?” is a question that forms the pivot of migration studies, and migration theory in particular. But it has hardly found satisfactory answers. In this article, I reapproach the question from an array of diverse angles and provide eight responses. Some are aligned with recent theoretical developments, others unpack long-standing ideas with evolving significance, and still others are fundamentally atheoretical. Together, they show how the question can be answered, how it is being answered—even inadvertently or misleadingly—and what the implications are of answering the question in different ways. These are the responses, which each initiates a discussion: (1) For the reasons under which they are admitted as immigrants; (2) For reasons that are socially legitimate; (3) Because the sum of push and pull factors is in favor of migration; (4) Because they have the aspiration and the ability to do so; (5) Because an opportunity presents itself; (6) Either because they chose to or because they are forced to; (7) Because they see migration as either intrinsically or instrumentally valuable; (8) To lead a normal life. The discussions demonstrate how theoretical, methodological and political dimensions of migration sway the ways in which reasons for migration are understood and represented. “Why do people migrate?” is slippery as a research question, but its indeterminate nature makes it a guiding light for research that navigates a diversity of perspectives with humility and curiosity.},

	abstract = {Thematic analysis is a well-established technique for qualitative analysis which is covered in traditional research methods training. The objective of thematic analysis is to elicit themes and significant topics from discursive data such as free style discussions and semi structured or unstructured interviews or comments. The approach is laborious and time consuming and requires a significant input from researchers for identifying and coding the themes although software tools such as NVivo, T-Lab and IRaMuTeQ can aid with results presentation. Recent developments in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have boosted interest in text analytics and its applications to social science research. For example, automatic topic identification using ML NLP offers valuable insights in social media analytics. However, machine learning techniques conventionally rely on large data sets to enable the algorithm to elicit themes. More recent research efforts have turned to the performance of machine learning approaches with smaller data sets.},
