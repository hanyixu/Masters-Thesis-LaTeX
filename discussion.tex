\section{Discussion}

This study makes several significant theoretical contributions to the understanding of interactive demands in video games, extending and validating Bowman's Interactive Demand Framework through computational analysis of naturalistic player discourse \parencite{vorderer_interactivity_2021}. The theoretical contributions span three primary domains: empirical validation, framework extensions, and methodological innovation.

\subsection{Empirical Validation of Interactive Demand Framework }

This investigation represents the first large-scale (N = 1,457 texts) computational analysis of the Interactive Demand Framework using naturalistic, spontaneous player discourse collected from Reddit gaming communities. By analyzing how players naturally discuss their gaming experiences without researcher prompting or predetermined response categories, this study provides ecological validation of the framework's conceptual structure. The analysis reveals that all five demand dimensions are empirically detectable and meaningfully present in player discourse:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cognitive Demands} (17.4\% of posts): Players spontaneously discuss strategic thinking, problem-solving, decision-making, and mental challenge. Common linguistic markers include terms such as "think," "strategy," "mode," "level," and "challenge," which indicate natural engagement with the cognitive dimensions of gameplay.
    \item \textbf{Emotional Demands} (17.1\% of posts): Players extensively articulate affective experiences, including excitement, frustration, satisfaction, and emotional intensity. The near-equivalent prevalence to cognitive demands (17.4\% vs. 17.1\%) suggests these two dimensions are psychologically intertwined in player experience, a finding that extends the framework as discussed in Section 8.1.2.
    \item \textbf{Social Demands} (15.2\% of posts): Discussions of teamwork, community, multiplayer coordination, and social dynamics demonstrate that social dimensions are central to contemporary gaming discourse. The prominence of platform names like "Steam" and social terms like "friend," "team," and "community" indicates that social demands extend beyond in-game mechanics to encompass broader gaming social ecosystems.
    \item \textbf{Physical Demands} (6.5\% of posts): While less frequently discussed, physical comfort, ergonomics, and bodily engagement emerge as discrete concerns in player discourse. The relatively lower frequency suggests physical demands may function as "hygiene factors" in gaming experience—assumed baseline conditions that become salient primarily when violated.
    \item \textbf{Controller Demands} (4.9\% of posts): Input responsiveness, control schemes, and interface design are the least frequently discussed dimensions but, critically, show the most extreme negative sentiment when mentioned (80.6\% negative valence). This pattern suggests controller demands operate similarly to physical demands as hygiene factors, but with even more severe consequences when problematic.
\end{enumerate}

The spontaneous emergence of all five demand dimensions in player-generated discourse, without researcher prompting or imposed frameworks, provides strong convergent validity for Bowman's conceptualization. Players do not use academic terminology like "cognitive load" or "emotional regulation," yet they naturally express these constructs through gaming-specific language. This demonstrates that the framework captures phenomenologically real aspects of player experience rather than researcher-imposed artifacts. Furthermore, the relative frequencies of demand mentions (cognitive and emotional dominating, followed by social, with physical and controller trailing) reveal a hierarchy of psychological salience that was not explicit in the original framework but emerges from player priorities. This distribution pattern suggests that cognitive and emotional demands are core to the gaming experience, social demands are increasingly important in contemporary multiplayer contexts, and physical/controller demands function as necessary but not sufficient baseline conditions.



\subsection{Implications for Game Designers and Developers}
\subsubsection{Cognitive Demand Design}
Theoretical insights from this analysis of interactive demands in naturalistic gaming can guide key stakeholders. This section explains how our findings inform three areas: game design, player community engagement, and research methods. By connecting theory to practice, these implications show the practical value of computational social science for understanding player experience. 

The finding that cognitive demands constitute the most frequently discussed dimension (17.4\% of all posts), accompanied by moderate positive sentiment (30.0\%) and substantial negative sentiment (67.7\%), has significant implications for difficulty design. This pattern indicates that cognitive challenge is central to the gaming experience, yet it is highly sensitive to calibration. The recurring use of the phrase "challenging but fair" among players underscores a core design principle that aims to strike a balance between difficulty and perceived fairness. Moderate positive sentiment suggests that appropriately calibrated cognitive demands promote satisfaction, accomplishment, and engagement, which are characteristic of flow states, as described by \textcite{cziksentmihalyi_flow_1990}. However, the predominance of negative sentiment reveals the challenges and frequency of failure in achieving optimal calibration. Players often report frustration when cognitive demands are excessively high ("impossible difficulty spike"), insufficiently challenging ("boring and repetitive"), or perceived as unfair ("fake difficulty through poor design").These findings yield several actionable design recommendations. First, adaptive difficulty systems, which automatically adjust game challenge based on player performance, should be prioritized as core features rather than optional enhancements. Second, difficulty curves should undergo extensive play testing across a broad spectrum of player skill levels, as what appears balanced to expert developers may be excessively challenging for average players. Third, transparency in difficulty mechanics, achieved by providing clear information about how and why challenges are structured, enables players to differentiate between personal skill limitations and design flaws. Providing explicit feedback regarding failure and strategies for improvement can convert frustrating cognitive demands into motivating challenges. Additionally, the strong correlation between cognitive and emotional demands (r = 0.190) demonstrates that cognitive design decisions have direct emotional consequences. Designers should evaluate not only the mechanical solvability of puzzles or combat encounters but also the emotional experience associated with the problem-solving process. Implementing incremental progress markers, partial success rewards, and clear learning trajectories can help ensure that cognitively demanding content elicits positive affect even before full mastery is achieved. 

\subsubsection{Controller Demand Design}
A particularly notable and actionable finding of this study is the pronounced sentiment pattern associated with controller demands, defined as the requirements and physical effort necessary to operate a game's controls or interface. Although only 4.9\% of posts address controller or interface issues, 80.6\% of these express negative sentiment. This represents the most skewed sentiment profile among all demand dimensions, underscoring a critical design principle. Controller responsiveness and interface transparency are essential prerequisites for a positive gaming experience. The combination of low discussion frequency and highly negative sentiment suggests that controller demands function as what \textcite{herzberg_work_1966} described as "hygiene factors", basic requirements that do not enhance player satisfaction when present but cause significant dissatisfaction when absent. Responsive controls and intuitive interfaces are rarely praised, as they are expected and often go unnoticed until they fail. When issues such as input lag, awkward button mappings, obstructive UI elements, or mismatched control schemes arise, the interface shifts from being an invisible tool to a source of frustration.These findings have important implications for development priorities. Input responsiveness must be regarded as a fundamental technical requirement rather than an optional enhancement. Rigorous testing of input latency, frame pacing, and control responsiveness across diverse hardware configurations should be integrated early and maintained throughout the development process. Games that deprioritize controller performance in favor of other features risk severe player dissatisfaction, regardless of strengths in other areas. As one player stated: "The game could have the best story ever, but if the controls suck, I'm not playing it."Interface design should emphasize transparency and learnability. \textcite{norman_design_2013} principles of good design are not merely aesthetic considerations but are fundamental to player engagement with core game content. Complex games, such as strategy, role-playing, and simulation titles, face unique challenges in presenting intricate mechanics without overwhelming users. Iterative usability testing with diverse player populations, including those unfamiliar with genre conventions, is essential for identifying interface friction points that may be overlooked by developers. Accessibility and customization options are not merely inclusive design choices, but essential quality-of-life features for all players. Features such as re-mappable controls, adjustable sensitivity, customizable UI scaling, and colorblind modes accommodate the diverse physical capabilities, gaming experience, and preferences of players. The pronounced frustration regarding controller issues in the data suggests that standardized input schemes may alienate portions of the player base.Platform-specific optimization, which involves tailoring controls and interfaces for different devices, is crucial because controller demands vary across PC, console, and mobile platforms. The frequent reference to "Steam" in controller-related discussions suggests that PC players are particularly sensitive to technical performance, likely due to hardware variability and the precision required by mouse and keyboard interfaces. Console players prioritize controller ergonomics and button layout, while mobile players focus on touch responsiveness and screen space. Cross-platform games should adapt their input schemes to each platform rather than relying on generic solutions that fail to fully meet the needs of any platform. 

\subsubsection{Social Demand Design}
The observation that social demands exhibit the highest positive sentiment (33.8\%) alongside substantial negative sentiment (63.5\%) indicates that social features are highly variable and polarizing elements within multiplayer gaming. Effective social interactions, such as finding compatible teammates, experiencing positive community dynamics, and engaging in coordinated play, are closely tied to peak gaming experiences. In contrast, failures in social interaction produce intensely negative experiences that may contribute to player attrition. The strong co-occurrence of social demands with both cognitive (r = 0.112) and emotional demands (r = 0.137) indicates that social features are deeply integrated with core gameplay experiences rather than functioning as isolated mechanics. Strategic coordination merges cognitive challenge with social interaction, while shared victories and defeats intensify emotional responses through social comparison and collective efficacy. Consequently, social features should be designed as fundamental components of the player experience ecosystem, not as optional add-ons.

These patterns inform several design recommendations for promoting positive social experiences and reducing toxicity. Robust moderation systems are essential infrastructure for any game featuring social components, rather than optional community management tools. The data indicate that toxic behavior, griefing, and harassment are significant drivers of negative sentiment that undermine the social experience. Effective moderation should encompass multiple layers, including automated detection of offensive language and disruptive behavior, player reporting mechanisms with responsive enforcement, and community guidelines that clearly define behavioral expectations and consequences. Positive reinforcement systems, such as League of Legends' Honor system or Overwatch's endorsement system, can complement punitive measures by rewarding prosocial behavior. Matchmaking systems should account for both player skill and behavioral preferences. The frequent reference to "toxic teammates" in negative social discourse suggests that skill-based balance alone is insufficient if behavioral incompatibility persists. Reputation systems that monitor communication style, cooperation, and sportsmanship can facilitate the matching of compatible players. Furthermore, offering multiple play modes, including competitive ranked play, casual unranked modes, and single-player or bot options, acknowledges the diverse social preferences among players.

Communication tools should be designed to support positive coordination while minimizing opportunities for harassment. While voice chat facilitates tactical coordination, it also introduces risks of verbal abuse; similarly, text chat enables strategic discussion but can be misused. Quick message systems, such as Rocket League's preset phrases, allow communication while reducing the potential for toxicity. The optimal communication design varies by genre, audience, and cultural context, but all systems should include muting, blocking, and reporting as standard features. Games targeting younger audiences or those with histories of toxic communities may benefit from more restrictive communication options, supplemented by context-sensitive quick messages. Social features should accommodate both interactions among strangers and established friend groups, as these contexts generate distinct social demands. Random matchmaking with strangers introduces coordination challenges but fosters social discovery, while playing with friends offers psychological safety but necessitates group management. Features such as clan systems, friends lists, party voice chat, and options for solo or team queues enable players to select their preferred level of social engagement. Community features that extend beyond in-game interactions can enrich the social dimension of gaming and promote a positive culture. The frequent mention of platform names, such as "Steam," and community spaces, like subreddits, in the data indicates that the gaming social experience persists beyond gameplay sessions. Developers who engage with these communities, support content creators, organize events, and cultivate inclusive cultures can positively influence the social demand experience outside of direct gameplay. 

\subsubsection{Physical Demand Design}
Although physical demands are discussed infrequently (6.5\% of posts), they elicit high negative sentiment (74.5\%) when mentioned, indicating that physical discomfort and ergonomic issues, while not a primary concern for most players, pose significant challenges for those affected. This pattern suggests that physical demands, similar to controller demands, function as hygiene factors: good ergonomics are rarely praised, but poor ergonomics prompt complaints and may prevent extended player engagement.Player discourse highlights several physical concerns, including hand fatigue from button-mashing or precision aiming, eye strain from extended screen time or inadequate visual contrast, back and neck pain from prolonged sitting, and motion sickness caused by certain camera movements or visual effects. Although these issues vary among individuals depending on physical characteristics and session duration, their presence in player discussions indicates that they constitute meaningful barriers to satisfaction for affected subpopulations.

Design recommendations for mitigating physical demands emphasize flexibility and accessibility. Control schemes should minimize repetitive strain by avoiding button-mashing mechanics, offering toggle options instead of hold-to-sprint, and designing combat systems that prioritize timing and positioning over input speed. Titles such as Dark Souls illustrate that strategic, deliberate combat can be both engaging and less physically demanding than reflex-based systems. Visual design should enhance eye comfort through adjustable brightness, contrast, and gamma settings, as well as options to reduce motion blur, screen shake, and camera shake. Colorblind-accessible palettes should also be provided. Pacing mechanisms, including natural breakpoints, session length warnings, and game play loops that encourage varied activities, can help prevent fatigue during extended sessions. Finally, supporting alternative control schemes ensures that physical limitations do not restrict access to content.

The increasing prominence of VR gaming heightens the importance of addressing physical demands, as VR introduces vestibular, kinesthetic, and proprioceptive factors not present in traditional gaming. VR developers should carefully consider comfort settings, locomotion options, session pacing, and physical space requirements to minimize the risk of motion sickness and fatigue. Lessons from traditional gaming regarding physical demands as hygiene factors are especially pertinent in VR, where these issues are magnified. 

\subsubsection{Emotional Demand Design}
The observation that emotional demands exhibit mixed valence (33.3\% positive and 65.5\% negative) indicates that emotional engagement in gaming is complex and multifaceted, rather than solely focused on maximizing enjoyment. This finding is consistent with research on meaningful media experiences, which demonstrates that games, like films and literature, can deliver value through a spectrum of emotions, including sadness, fear, anger, and moral discomfort (Oliver and Bartsch, 2010). The strong correlation between emotional and cognitive demands (r = 0.190) further indicates that emotional responses are integrated with intellectual engagement. These findings challenge the assumption that game design should prioritize maximizing positive affect and minimizing negative affect. Instead, they suggest that emotional richness and intensity may be more valuable than a singular focus on positivity. Games that pursue artistic expression, narrative depth, or moral complexity should strive to encompass the full range of human emotions, rather than limiting themselves to hedonic pleasure.This perspective has implications for narrative design, mechanical feedback, and moment-to-moment pacing. Narrative-driven games can incorporate themes such as loss, sacrifice, moral ambiguity, and emotional vulnerability without concern that negative emotions will deter players; these themes may, in fact, foster more memorable and meaningful experiences. Mechanical design can employ emotional pacing by alternating tension and relief, challenge and mastery, and setbacks and triumphs to create dynamic affective trajectories. Visual and audio design can utilize atmosphere, music, and aesthetic choices to evoke specific emotional tones, ranging from the sustained dread of horror games to the bittersweet reflection of melancholic indie titles. However, the data also indicate limits to players' tolerance for negative affect. While negative emotions are accepted as part of engaging experiences, extreme or prolonged negativity without resolution leads to dissatisfaction. Frustration from difficulty is acceptable when it results in mastery and accomplishment, and fear in horror games is enjoyable because players can control their exposure and seek relief. Emotional design should therefore incorporate agency, pacing, and resolution, rather than subjecting players to a continuous stream of negativity. The balance between emotional intensity and player control determines whether negative emotions are perceived as meaningfully challenging or merely punitive.
